PySIApp is an application for performing certain important applications
 and tasks encountered in signal integrity.
 These basic applications are:

s-parameters in systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic philosophy behind this tool can be summarized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A high percentage of tasks required by signal integrity engineers that are
 usually performed using expensive, closed, black box systems can be performed
 using this free, open-source tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While software tools are powerful and really help the signal integrity engineer,
 there are certain common mistakes made due to both quality of data input
 to the tools, and lack of basic understanding of what the tool is doing.
 We address these two issues by supplying many capabilities for understanding
 the quality of your input data, usually in the form of s-parameter files,
 and providing complete explanation of what the tool is doing all the way
 from theory (in the book that accompanies this software) and in the form
 of the software itself which can be examined and even modified.

\begin_layout Section
S-parameter Generation
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section explains how to use PySIApp to generate the s-parameters of
 a system.
 Read through the following sections on how to accomplish this, or skip

\begin_layout Subsection
Drawing a Schematic for S-parameter Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When PySIApp opens, you have a blank canvas and are ready to draw a schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename BlanckCanvas.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drawing the schematic is accomplished through the addition of parts, ports
 and wires.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add parts to the schematic, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Part"

\end_inset

.
 To add wires to the schematic, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Wire"

\end_inset

.
 See the next section about 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Attaching Ports to a Schematic
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Attaching-Ports-to-a-Schematic"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ports define the s-parameters of the final circuit.
 As you must be aware, s-parameters are a vector of matrix elements, where
 each matrix element is for a particular frequency (these frequencies are
 defined by the calculation properties defined in the next section: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Setting-Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

) and each matrix defines the complex port-port relationship at that frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for a set of two-port s-parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{21}$
\end_inset

 refers to the port-port relationship as the output (reflected) wave from
 port 2 due to an incident wave on port 1 over all the frequencies.
 These port numbers are defined by the port element added in the schematic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add ports to a schematic, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Setting Calculation Properties
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Setting-Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set the calculation properties for s-parameter calculation, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties determine how the s-parameters are calculated,
 specifically the frequency points that are calculated.
 The calculation properties are the same set for all of the PySI applications.
 With regard to s-parameter calculation, the elements of particular interest
 are the end frequency, which is the last frequency in the s-parameter calculati
on, and the frequency points, which are the number of frequency points that
 will be present in the final s-parameters calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Calculating S-parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating the schematic for s-parameter generation and setting the
 calculation properties, the s-parameters are calculated using either the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-S-parameters"

\end_inset

 command or the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-Button"

\end_inset

 toolbar button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that calculation will not be possible at all (i.e.
 the menu elements are disabled) if the schematic does not meet the criteria
 for s-parameter calculation.
 This criteria for the schematic regarding elements are that the schematic
 must:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have at least one port element (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Port"

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
not have any other elements that don't make sense for s-parameter generation
 including:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
output probes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
measure probes

\begin_layout Itemize
stims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
unknown devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
system devices
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In calculating the s-parameters, the first step is to convert the schematic
 shown into a net list.
 This netlist puts the graphical schematic into a text based description.
 Note that this netlist can be created, examined and saved separately if
 you want.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlists"

\end_inset

 for more information on the net list and see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Export-Netlist"

\end_inset

 on ways of viewing and exporting the net lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net list is passed to a 
\series bold
SystemSParametersNumericParser
\series default
 class as described in the PySI book after which the s-parameters are extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During parsing of the net list, all devices listed are instantiated with
 the end frequency and number of frequency points specified.
 If a file device is encountered, the s-parameters read from the file are
 resampled onto the end frequency and number of frequency points specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, for each frequency point, the s-parameters are generated of the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, things go wrong and an error is generated.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Errors-and-Exceptions"

\end_inset

 for an explanation of any errors generated during calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If everything goes correctly, a dialog will open with the ability to view
 the s-parameters calculated and save them to a file.
 See the section on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Viewer"

\end_inset

 for more information on the viewing of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
S-parameter Generation Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:S-parameter-Generation-Example"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this example we will generate the mixed-mode s-parameters of a differential
 transmission line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We start by opening the file provided in the examples.
 The file is included with the PySIApp and can be found at ./Examples/SParameterG
enerationExample.xml:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExample.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we see three devices and four ports.
 We added the devices by executing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Part"

\end_inset

, opening the Files category, and selecting the Four Port File device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPickerFourPortFile.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, we select the file: Sparq_demo_16.s4p.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename FourPortFileProperties.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SparqDemo16Selection.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also selected the left-most checkbox on the file name property so that
 it displays in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK and clicking the mouse causes the part to appear in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, our schematic looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep1.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice the red x's showing where the part pins are unconnected.
 Also note that the part is blue and the status message says 
\emph on
Part Selected
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then add the mixed-mode converter devices by again executing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Part"

\end_inset

, opening the Miscellaneous category, and selecting the Power Mixed Mode
 Converter.
 (This device is explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Power-Mixed-Mode-Converter"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPickerPowerMixedModeConverter.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part has no properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK and clicking the mouse causes the part to appear in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, our schematic looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep2.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we are converting single-ended to mixed-mode s-parameters, we need
 to hook the positive and negative ports of the left and right sides of
 the four-port device to the mixed-mode converters.
 But we don't really know for sure where the positive and negative ports
 are on this device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find out, we select our four port device and invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Edit-Properties"

\end_inset

.
 This brings up the part properties dialog again for the file device:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleFileProperties.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next to the file name, we see the view button.
 Pressing this brings up the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Viewer"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The s-parameters to view are selected from the box of buttons in the lower
 left.
 Selecting s31, we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleS31.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and selecting s41 we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleS41.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
s31 is clearly the positive thru response for the single-ended ports 1 and
 3 and s41 is clearly the ac-coupled response of the other input port to
 output port 3.
 There is no indication necessarily of which ports are inputs our outputs
 (i.e.
 on the left or right of the device) and no indication which of the input
 or output ports should be designated plus or minus, but it is safe to choose
 ports 1 and 2 as the left plus and minus ports and ports 3 and 4 as the
 right plus and minus ports (note that we should look at s42 and s41 to
 confirm this).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will need two mixed-mode converters.
 We have one already, so we drag it over and connect the plus and minus
 ports to ports 3 and 4 of our four-port transmission line as shown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep3.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's easy to get another mixed-mode converter on the other side.
 Just invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Duplicate-Part"

\end_inset

 with the mixed-mode converter selected and when the cursor changes to a
 finger, just click on the left of the file device to place a copy of the
 part.
 Since it is the wrong orientation, invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Flip-Horizontally"

\end_inset

 to flip it around and drag it into position as shown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep4.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Port"

\end_inset

 to add ports to the circuit.
 When we do this, we see the part properties dialog for the port:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertiesPort.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the port number 1 has already been filled in.
 Press OK and click and drag the port into place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep5.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is customary for mixed-mode s-parameters to have ports 1, 2, 3, and 4
 to be D1, D2, C1, C2 where the D and C refer to the differential- or common-mod
e and the 1 and 2 refer to the left and right side of the transmission line.
 So we invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Duplicate-Part"

\end_inset

 and click the mouse and drag the new port to the right side of the device.
 Use 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Flip-Horizontally"

\end_inset

 to flip the port around and place it as shown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep6.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rest of the ports are added in a similar manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExample.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to set the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
 By default they look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationPropertiesDefault.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we looked at the s-parameters, we can see that the end frequency is
 20 GHz and the impulse response length is 100 ns.
 It looks like the 100 ns impulse response length might be excessive, so
 we use 50 ns.
 We double click in the impulse response length entry box and type 50n and
 press enter.
 Now we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationProperties50ns.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, in general, we really don't want to think of the number of frequency
 points in an s-parameter file.
 Instead, we choose to think in terms of impulse response length.
 In this example, this happens to mean one thousand frequency points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before calculating the s-parameters, it's also good to look at the netlist.
 Invoking 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Export-Netlist"

\end_inset

, we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleNetListDialog.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've read the book that accompanies the PySI software, this netlist
 should be familiar to you.
 If you press OK, you can save this netlist to a file, if you wanted to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the s-parameters, invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-Button"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-S-parameters"

\end_inset

.
 There should not be any errors (if there are, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Errors-and-Exceptions"

\end_inset

) and you should see the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
Simulation is about applying voltage or current stimulus waveforms to a
 circuit and measuring the resulting waveforms at various nodes in the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides step-by-step instructions for simulation.
 You can read through this, or go immediately to the

\begin_layout Standard
The stimulus to the circuit is applied through special parts.
 These special parts are categorized as

 specified from a file.
 A generator supplies some specified input 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

.
 Sources and generators can be voltages or currents and can supply input
 waveforms from files, pulses, steps, and sine waves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probing points in the circuit for providing the output waveforms are
 specified through the use of 
\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\emph default
.
 An output probe supplies the location of the node for which the output
 waveform is desired, the name of the waveform in the simulation, and any
 gain, offset, or delay to be applied.
 In that sense it operates like a real probe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you are ready for simulation, you should configure the Calculation
 properties.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a circuit is drawn containing at least one source or generator, and
 at least one output probe, presumably with a circuit that has been properly
 configured, you can simulate the circuit.
 Simulation involves the calculation of transfer parameters which are applied
 to the input waveforms to generate the output waveforms and the waveforms
 are displayed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties determine how the transfer parameters are calculated.
 Transfer parameters are frequency responses that define transfer characteristic
s from an input waveform to an output waveform.
 Input waveforms come from sources and output waveforms are provided at
 output probe locations in the circuit.
 An output waveform is a linear combination of input waveforms applied to
 filters that are the time-domain equivalent of the frequency responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency responses are calculated to the end frequency withe the frequency
 spacing specified, and the filters are calculated by taking the inverse-FFT
 of these frequency responses.
 As such, they end up having a sample rate that is twice the end frequency
 and an impulse response length that is the inverse of the frequency resolution
 and a number of points that are twice the number of frequency points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base sample rate should be set to the sample rate that you want the
 simulation to run at, which is twice the end frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These impulse responses generated for the filters are always centered on
 time zero, meaning half of the impulse response is before time zero and
 half is after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that all of the s-parameters have been sampled sufficiently, meaning
 to the right end frequency and most importantly, with the proper spacing
 to provide an impulse response that does not have time-aliasing effects,
 then it is possible to specify an appropriate impulse response length in
 the calculation properties.
 But with the tool in its current state, there is no way to guarantee this
 - you must set it to a value that makes sense.
 But the key is that it must be long enough.
 If it is too short, the simulator produces incorrect waveforms.
 If it is too long, it just needs to do extra work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advice here is to set the impulse response length to a number that is
 twice the length of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter in time as how
 long you think the impulse response of the longest filter should be.
 Then, after the simulation completes, you should view the transfer parameters
 from the simulator dialog to make sure that this occurred.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep18.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, of course nonsense, so let's understand what happened here and
 how the simulator works.
 Understand this, we need on more set of information - the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

, where we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationPropertiesDefault.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulator operates by generating transfer parameters that convert waveforms
 generated from sources, in this case the step generator, into the output
 waveforms.
 In this case, since we have only one source, these are essentially two
 filters that are applied to the source waveform, one filter converting
 the source to Vin, the other converting the source to Vout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These filters are specified with a frequency response of 400 points with
 50 MHz spacing out to 20 GHz.
 If s-parameter files had appeared in the schematic, all s-parameters would
 be resampled to this specification during calculation of the transfer parameter
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net effect of the transfer parameters calculation is two finite-impulse
 response (FIR) filters whose impulse response length is 20 ns.
 In the accompanying book that describes the theory, we explain all about
 this, but suffice it to say that the filter impulse response is 20 ns long
 with time 0 appearing in the middle (i.e.
 has 10 ns of filter duration prior to time zero and 10 ns after time zero).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since FFT methods are utilized, and since the FFT assumes that the frequency
 response represents the 
\emph on
impulse train response
\emph default
 (as opposed to a single impulse response), we have an opportunity for time-alia
sing effects, which we've certainly created.
 To see this, invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:View-Transfer-Parameters"

\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

 and we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep19.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the trivial filter that converts the source waveform VG1 into Vin.
 this filter is, of course, a single impulse as these two are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selecting Vout due to VG1 shows something more interesting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep20.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we see that the filter is highly resonant, which is not surprising.
 We see this in the magnitude response in the upper left, to some degree
 from the 180 degree phase transition in the phase response in the upper
 right, in the impulse response in the lower left which is clearly not settled
 at the end, and we see the problem the most clearly from the step response
 in the lower right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the FFT methods utilized, we see that the unsettled response
 to the right continues from the left (at negative time) and is clearly
 giving us the wrong answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, we might provide better or automated ways of dealing with
 this, but this is a common problem, especially when s-parameters are used,
 and is worth seeing and dealing with manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, 20 ns worth of impulse response is insufficient.
 Let's use something like 100 ns.
 So we edit the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

, change the impulse response length to 100 ns, close the dialog returning
 to the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

, and recalculate.
 After adjusting the zoom a bit, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep21.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is clearly a much better result.
 You can examine the transfer parameters to see that the 100 ns impulse
 response did the trick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining the calculation properties we see the implications of the 100
 ns impulse response:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep22.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It means that two thousand frequency points were required at 10 MHz spacing.
 If this system were provided through s-parameter measurements, this would
 be the frequency resolution required to get a good time-domain simulation
 - regardless of what kind of simulator were employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final note, note that in the original, incorrect simulation, the waveform
 result was almost 200 ns long (it was 180 ns to be precise) and that the
 final result is 100 ns long.
 This is because the impulse response length is removed half from the front
 and half from the back of the waveform.
 This is explained in the accompanying book.
 This means that the input waveform must be sized properly to give you the
 result you want.
 If in my simulation, my desire was to see the step response starting at
 -10 ns until 30 ns, and understanding that the filter takes 50 ns from
 the front and back, we'd want an input waveform that starts at -60 ns and
 ends at 80 ns, for a 140 ns duration.

The calculation properties determine how the deembedded s-parameters are
 calculated, specifically the frequency points that are calculated.
 The calculation properties are the same set for all of the PySI applications.
 With regard to deembedding, the elements of particular interest are the
 end frequency, which is the last frequency in the s-parameter calculation,
 and the frequency points, which are the number of frequency points that
 will be present in the final s-parameters calculated.

You will have a problem if the end frequency specified extends beyond any

tes s-parameters by setting all of the results to zero beyond the end frequency.
 This means that the deembedding operation will almost certainly fail at
 these points.

\begin_layout Standard
After creating the schematic for s-parameter generation and setting the
 calculation properties, the s-parameters of the unknowns are calculated
 using either the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Deembed"

\end_inset

 command or the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-Button"

\end_inset

 toolbar button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that deembedding will not be possible at all (i.e.
 the menu elements are disabled) if the schematic does not meet the criteria
 for deembedding.
 This criteria for the schematic regarding elements are that the schematic
 must:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have at least one port element (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Port"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have at least one 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Itemize
have one

In the deembedding calculation, the first step is to convert the schematic
 shown into a net list.
 This netlist puts the graphical schematic into a text based description.
 Note that this netlist can be created, examined and saved separately if
 you want.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlists"

\end_inset

 for more information on the net list and see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Export-Netlist"

\end_inset

 on ways of viewing and exporting the net lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net list is passed to a 
\series bold
DeembedderNumericParser
\series default
 class as described in the PySI book after which the s-parameters of the
 unknowns are extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During parsing of the net list, all devices listed are instantiated with
 the end frequency and number of frequency points specified.
 If a file device is encountered, the s-parameters read from the file are
 resampled onto the end frequency and number of frequency points specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, for each frequency point, the s-parameters of the unknowns are calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, things go wrong and an error is generated.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

If everything goes correctly, a dialog will open for each of the unknowns
 with the ability to view the s-parameters calculated and save them to a
 file.

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
When s-parameters have been calculated, they are calculated according to
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

 as specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties that you are allowed to specify force the result
 to be evenly spaced points from zero frequency to the end frequency specified.
 But for files read from the disk and produced outside these tools, the
 frequencies are often at odd locations and frequently don't include the
 zero frequency points.
 In these cases, the impulse response and step response cannot be shown
 and the panes are blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the dialog panes have their own, independent control of panning
 and zooming.
 These controls come standard with MatPlotLib (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://matplotlib.org"

\end_inset

), the standard Python way of plotting things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the panes are an array of buttons determining the s-parameters being
 shown.
 If transfer parameters are being shown, the buttons are named not by port
 numbers but rather as relationships between, in the case of simulation,
 output probe voltages and source voltages or, in the case of virtual probing,
 output probe voltages and measurement probe voltages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory behind the s-parameter viewer dialog is that examination of s-paramet
ers, particularly for signal integrity, must include the time-domain, as
 the time-domain tells you how the s-parameters will perform in time-domain
 simulations.
 Speaking simply, the impulse response of the s-parameter shown is equivalent
 to a time-domain filter that filters waveforms.
 When viewing the impulse response, you should be looking for causality
 and settling issues caused mostly by insufficient frequency resolution.
 If there are bumps in the impulse response prior to time zero or prior
 to the electrical length of the device (that are not insignificant), then
 you have causality violations.
 If the impulse occurs near the end of the impulse response and you see
 remnants that wrap to the beginning of the response, you have insufficient
 frequency resolution.
 The step response highlights these type of problems and additionally show
 problems when impulse responses settle to non-zero values at the beginning
 and end of the response.
 If you have these response problems from s-parameters read from a file,
 then there is really nothing you can do with them.
 If you have these issues as a result of a calculation, then sometimes these
 problems can be repaired by changing the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the s-parameter file being viewed is an input file to any of the PySIApp
 applications, then the file will end up getting resampled according to
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

 and the viewer is a good way to see the effects of this resampling, most
 importantly in the time-domain.
 As mentioned, if the s-parameter viewer dialog is invoked on a file, then
 the file is shown as read.
 Selecting resample from either the Calculate menu or the resample button
 shows what the s-parameters will look like when resampled by the application.
 If the time-domain results look poor after resampling, then you have a
 problem.
 Currently, in this version of PySIApp, the resampling algorithms are geared
 towards strictly proper resampling of files with equally spaced points
 and the application does a poor job of extrapolation.
 Part of this is on purpose, because you really should make sure that your
 measurement instruments or other simulation tools provide the proper s-paramete
r files, but in the future, the intent is to add many more tools and algorithms
 for properly dealing with these situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the s-parameter viewer dialog, you have the ability to read
 another file, or write the file to the disk using the file menu commands
 or toolbar buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the phase response there is the ability to unwrap the phase.
 Pressing this button does not strictly unwrap the phase, but calculates
 the principle delay in the impulse response (if the impulse response can
 be calculated) and removes this delay from the phase response shown.
 In the future, the intent is to probably entirely unwrap the phase, and
 to show the phase only when the magnitude response is not unreasonably
 small.

The most useful and generic type of part for s-parameter files is the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you add a part, you first see the part picker, which lists all of the
 part categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPicker.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By selecting a part category, you find the parts listed in that category:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPickerCategory.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You select a part and press OK to bring up the part properties dialog:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifier.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, you see the part properties at the top, followed
 by the part orientation settings, followed by a picture of the part as
 it will be shown in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the value.
 When first opened for a part, the default values are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the property is to be shown in the
 schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox determines whether the keyword for the property is displayed
 (unchecking this box just shows the value).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).
 PySIApp never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 100 MOhm can be entered as 100 MOhm, 100 M, 100M, 100e6, or
 10e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference designator is entered by PySIApp and is always unique at the
 time of entry.
 In that sense, it does not need to be modified or viewed in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientation of a part can be altered through rotation and mirroring.
 The rotation shown is always for a rotation in the counter-clockwise direction,
 but usually one just presses the toggle button until it looks right.
 Mirroring vertically or horizontally is accomplished by checking the boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have no control over the exact placement of the text displayed with
 each part.
 It is placed justified properly depending on the orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many parts, there are alternate part pictures available.
 These are chosen by simply clicking inside the the part picture area of
 the dialog.
 For example, for the voltage amplifier shown, there is an alternate picture
 that has the voltage reference reversed at the input.
 Clicking in the part picture changes the picture to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifierAlt.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you are satisfied with all of the part property settings and the orientati
on, press okay.
 The part properties dialog disappears and, when hovered over the canvas,
 you will see that your mouse cursor has now changed to a finger to indicate
 that the part can now be placed.
 left-clicking now has the part shown and selected:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VoltageAmplifierAltSelected.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keeping the button pressed, the part remains selected and can be precisely
 placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that until a part is connected, you will see red x's wherever the unconnect
ed pins are on the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the part properties after the part has been placed, simply double-clic
k on the part to bring up the part properties, or select the device and
 use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Edit-Properties"

\end_inset

 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any time in the process of adding a part, you press the Cancel button
 (or <escape>), the part addition is aborted and you return to the schematic
 with no new part added.

\begin_layout Standard
This command is used to add ports to a schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ports are only added to schematics intended for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Generation"

\end_inset

 or for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Deembedding"

\end_inset

 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you add a port, the application immediately brings up the part property
 dialog for the port:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertiesPort.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this dialog, you see the only property, the port number, the orientation
 settings for the port, and a picture of the port element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The port part property are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the port number.
 The port number is filled in by default as the lowest port number not already
 in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the port number should be shown in
 the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox is superfluous for ports.
 For part properties it determines whether the keyword for the property
 should be shown, but a port number does not have a keyword, just the number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The port number is modified by clicking inside the white area where the
 port number value is shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the port number that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new port number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
keep in mind that when you have completed drawing your schematic, the port
 number values must be numbered from 1 to however many ports are present
 with no gaps in the numbers.
 Otherwise you will get an error when you go to calculate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are satisfied with the port number and orientation, press OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties dialog disappears and, when hovered over the canvas,
 you will see that your mouse cursor has now changed to a finger to indicate
 that the port can now be placed.
 left-clicking now has the port shown and selected:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keeping the button pressed, the port remains selected and can be precisely
 placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that until a port is connected, you will see a red x at the port connection
 point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the port number after the port has been placed, simply double-click
 on the part to bring up the part properties, or select the port and use
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any time in the process of adding a port, you press the Cancel button

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also available through the context sensitive menu (right-click when
 part selected).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a part is selected, editing the part properties brings up the part
 properties dialog:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifier.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, you see the part properties at the top, followed
 by the part orientation settings, followed by a picture of the part as
 it will be shown in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the value.
 When first opened for a part, the default values are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the property is to be shown in the
 schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox determines whether the keyword for the property is displayed
 (unchecking this box just shows the value).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).
 PySIApp never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 100 MOhm can be entered as 100 MOhm, 100 M, 100M, 100e6, or
 10e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference designator is entered by PySIApp and is always unique at the
 time of entry.
 In that sense, it does not need to be modified or viewed in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientation of a part can be altered through rotation and mirroring.
 The rotation shown is always for a rotation in the counter-clockwise direction,
 but usually one just presses the toggle button until it looks right.
 Mirroring vertically or horizontally is accomplished by checking the boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have no control over the exact placement of the text displayed with
 each part.
 It is placed justified properly depending on the orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many parts, there are alternate part pictures available.
 These are chosen by simply clicking inside the the part picture area of
 the dialog.
 For example, for the voltage amplifier shown, there is an alternate picture
 that has the voltage reference reversed at the input.
 Clicking in the part picture changes the picture to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifierAlt.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you are satisfied with all of the part property settings and the orientati
on, press OK.
 The part is now edited in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any time you press Cancel, the properties of the part are left unchanged
 in the schematic.

\begin_layout Standard
The Add Wire command puts the schematic state-machine in the drawing wires
 state.
 When in this state, the cursor turns into a pencil and a wire is begun.
 A wire is defined by a sequence of vertices.
 clicking the left mouse button drops another vertex onto the schematic.
 If at least one vertex has been placed for a wire, a rubber band line extends
 from the last vertex placed to the grid coordinate closest to the cursor
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wires can only be placed on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you right click, that ends the current wire.
 If a vertex has been placed for the current wire (and a rubber band line
 is extending to the cursor), the rubber band line disappears, the vertices
 place define the wire drawn in the schematic and a new wire starts.
 The next left click places a vertex for that wire and the process continues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wire drawing ends when you right click twice.
 In other words, it ends when you right click in the middle of drawing a
 wire and no vertices for that wire have been placed.
 Pressing escape will also end wire drawing.

Issuing the Calculation Properties command brings up the calculation properties
 dialog:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationPropertiesDefault.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties are intended for use with all of the PySIApp
 applications and consist of virtually entirely interrelated properties.
 The base properties are the end frequency and the impulse response length.
 All other properties are based on one or both of these properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
frequencyPoints=endFrequency\cdot impulseResponseLength
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
frequencyResolution=\frac{1}{impulseResponseLength}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
baseSampleRate=2\cdot endFrequency
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
timePoints=2\cdot endFrequency\cdot impulseResponseLength
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).
 PySIApp never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 20 GHz can be entered as 20 GHz, 20 G, 20G, 20e6, or 2e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever either the end frequency or the impulse response length are modified,
 all of the other properties are calculated as in the equations above.
 If any of the properties are modified that directly affect one of these
 base properties, then the affected base property is modified and all of
 the other properties are recalculated as stated.
 These properties include the frequency resolution, which is simply another
 expression of the impulse response length, and the base sample rate, which
 is simply another expression of the end frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, if either the frequency points or the time points are modified,
 which are functions of both of the base properties, then the end frequency
 is held constant and the impulse response length is modified to accommodate
 the new property value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, all of the properties can be modified.
 Any modification first tries to hold the end frequency (and base sample
 rate) constant first and the impulse response length second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting thing to note is that the frequency points are actually
 the number of frequencies minus one.
 Said differently, the number of actual frequencies calculated is always
 the number shown plus one.
 In other words, for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 frequency points and an end frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $Fe$
\end_inset

, the actual frequency points are, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in0\ldots N$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left[n\right]=\frac{n}{N}\cdot Fe
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time points for the impulse response is specified for 
\begin_inset Formula $K=2\cdot N$
\end_inset

 time points and a sample rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Fs=2\cdot Fe$
\end_inset

, as having times of, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in0\ldots K-1$
\end_inset

 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

t\left[k\right]=\left(k-\frac{K}{2}\right)\cdot\frac{1}{Fs}

Control help allows you to get help on any command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in control help, all of the commands are activated.
 This includes key bindings, toolbar buttons, and menu elements.
 However, issuing any of the possible commands takes you to a location in
 the help system corresponding to the desired control instead of actually
 issuing the command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Control help stays active until you either press the escape key, or touch
 somewhere in the canvas.

\begin_layout Standard
All s-parameter files must have an extension '.s[x]p' where x is the number
 of ports.
 This is the only way to precisely determine the number of ports in an s-paramet

During calculation, the netlist is parsed to set up the calculation.
 In this process, various things can go wrong because of incorrect specification
 of the netlist:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unconnected Device Ports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One or more device ports in the schematic is not connected.
 With the exception of the system device used in deembedding applications,
 all device ports must be connected to one or more other device ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, by looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected
 device ports will have a red x on device pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the device port makes the
 red x disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and the
 wire itself might not be connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can troubleshoot connection problems exactly by looking at the netlist.
 The netlist will list each device with a name and number of ports and will
 list all connections between device ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Duplicate Device Name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One or more devices in your schematic has the same device name.
 Usually, as you add devices to the schematic, you do not worry about the
 reference designations and the application adds unique reference designators
 as parts are added.
 These reference designators can be edited, however, by the user and the
 user can enter reference designations that are the same accidentally.
 To troubleshoot this problem, you can look both at the schematic, specifically
 the part properties for the devices, and at the netlist which will have
 device declarations with the same device name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No Device Named
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A connection or other type of declaration specifies a device name that is
 nonexistent.
 This type of error ought to be impossible to create from the application
 and is more typical of hand generated netlists.
 Nevertheless, this error message indicates that the netlist contains a
 reference to a device name (listed in the error) that is not specified
 elsewhere in the netlist.
 An error like this is really an internal error, but you can see the cause
 of an error like this by examining the netlist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Cannot Connect Device Ports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the same error as No Device Named, except that it was explicitly
 called in an attempt to connect non-existent device ports.
 It also handles non-existent ports of the device if they cannot be found.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No Outputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no output probes in the circuit.
 This type of error ought to be difficult to create from the application
 because the application checks for the existence of at least one output
 probe prior to enabling the simulation calculation, but it does not check
 whether the output probe is actually connected to anything.
 It is useful to leave some output probes unconnected and floating in the
 schematic to avoid calculation (for example, it might have been used for
 troubleshooting), but at least one of the output probes must be connected
 to the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected output
 probes will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the output probe makes the
 red x disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and the
 wire itself might not be connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No Sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no sources in the circuit.
 This type of error ought to be impossible to create from the application
 because the application checks for the existence of at least one source
 prior to enabling the simulation calculation, but it does not check whether
 the output probe is actually connected to anything.
 If it is not connected, it ought to generate an Unconnected Device Ports
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected sources
 will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the pins of a source makes
 the red x's disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire)
 and the wire itself might not be connected to anything.

No Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no measure probes in the circuit.
 This type of error ought to be difficult to create from the application
 because the application checks for the existence of at least one measure
 probe prior to enabling the simulation calculation, but it does not check
 whether the measure probe is actually connected to anything.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected measure
 probes will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the measure probe makes the
 red x disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and the
 wire itself might not be connected to anything.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
No Sources
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are no sources in the circuit.
 In the context of virtual probing, sources mean stims as a stim looks like
 a source in the depths of the calculation.
 The application checks for the existence of at least one stim prior to
 enabling the virtual probe calculation, but it does not check whether the
 stim is actually connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can examine unconnected stims, because
 they will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the pins of a stim makes the
 red x's disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and
 the wire itself might not be connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stims also require that the end of the arrow is connected directly to a
 device port.
 This is because unlike waves which are present along a wire, stims represent
 waves that emanate from a device port.
 Unfortunately, the schematic editor allows you to make this mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, stims must be connected to only one device port.
 While the schematic editor allows device ports to be connected directly
 together, when a stim is connected to a device port, the device port must
 be separated from others in the schematic by a small piece of wire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Numerical Error
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the same error as Cannot Invert I-W or I-Wxx while calculating the
 virtual probe transfer parameters.
 It indicates pathological problems in the system described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Incorrect Matrix Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cryptic error is an all encompassing error to indicate that something
 is wrong with the number of stims or measures in your system.
 In virtual probing, the number of independent stims (stims without the
 non-arrow side connected) must be less than or equal to the number of measure
 probes in the system.
 This error probably indicates that this is not the case (I say probably
 because there are other sources of this error especially when hand created
 netlists are entered into the system).

Cannot Invert I-W or I-Wxx 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding this error involves understanding the theory in the accompanying
 book.
 Suffice it to say that the problem is ill-determined in the sense that
 the system characteristics matrix is not invertible.
 This occurs under many pathological cases, some of which can be worked
 around and others cannot (i.e.
 there is simply no solution to the problem).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a pathological case that cannot be worked around are attempts
 to deembed elements in systems where elements are present that do not pass
 anything (at a given frequency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of pathological cases that can be worked around are circuit nodes
 whose absolute voltage or current cannot be determined due to the construction
 of the circuit.
 Sometimes, these can be worked around through the insertion of large resistors
 to ground or tiny series resistors.
 A detailed examination of the circuit would be necessary.

Mandatory Keywords Not Supplied
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This error message states that mandatory keywords and values were not supplied
 to the device parser for a particular device.
 The keyword error looks like: ['keyword1','keyword2',\SpecialChar \ldots{}
] for 'deviceName'
 where 'keyword1' and 'keyword2' are representative of keywords that must
 be defined for the device and 'deviceName' is representative of the name
 of the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a keyword is '', then the device takes an argument without a keyword
 (the keyword is inherent).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an error message that says that the keywords not supplied are:
 [''] for file, this means that the file name (which is not specified with
 a keyword) was not supplied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering netlists by hand, it is easy to forget a mandatory keyword,
 but in PySIApp, this is difficult since the application creates the netlist
 entry from the instantiated part in the schematic.
