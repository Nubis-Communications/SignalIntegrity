    """Implements the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for non-linear fitting

    To use this class, you derive your class for fitting some arbitrary
    function to some data from LeVmar.  The function must contain, at a minimum, an
    __init__ function for construction and a function fF(self,a), which implements
    the function y=f(a) where ideally a is a vector of numbers and y is a vector of
    numbers in matrix form.  In other words, if you are fitting a 3 variable function
    f(a0,a1,a2)=y - you are trying to find the best values of a0, a1, and a2 that
    cause f(a0,a1,a2) to be the closes to y in a least-squares sense, then your
    a would be something like [[a0],[a1],[a2]] and your y would look similar.  In
    this way, a is a 3x1 element matrix.

    During the fit, LevMar will call the function fJ, which in turn calls fPartialFPartiala
    with a and m being the index of the variable in a to take the derivative with respect
    to. If your derived class does not overload fJ and/or fPartialFPartiala, LevMar will
    compute a numerical derivative using the value self.m_epsilon as the delta.  If
    you have analytic derivatives and don't want derivatives calculated numerically,
    you overload fJ and return a matrix that is R a M where R is the number of elements
    in y and M is the number of elements in a where each J[r][m] is the partial derivative
    of F with respect a[m] at element r of the output.
