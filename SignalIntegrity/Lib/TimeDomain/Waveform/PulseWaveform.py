        constructs a waveform with a single pulse.
        @param td instance of class TimeDescriptor containing time axis of waveform.
        @param Amplitude (optional) float amplitude of pulse (defaults to unity).
        @param StartTime (optional) float starting time of the pulse (defaults to zero).
        @param PulseWidth (optional) float the width of the pulse (defaults to zero).
        @param Risetime (optional) float risetime in seconds (defaults to 0.)
        @note The amplitude can be positive or negative, with negative providing a negative
        pulse.
        @note if the pulse appears entirely within the samples, then the waveform will be all zero.
        @note actual risetime used is the sample period if less than that is specified
        @note risetime is applied on the rising and falling edge.  risetimes greater than
        1.72 times the pulse width will diminish the pulse amplitude.
        @note the risetime is applied such that the pulse reaches half amplitude at the start
        time specified.  Please note the expected non-causality.
