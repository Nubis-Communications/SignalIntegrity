    @param Z0 - the reference impedance

    @remark
    This very useful function helps resolve all of the possibilities for
    specification of reference impedance and scaling factor under the multitude
    of possibilities on how it can be provided to various conversion functions

    It operates by selecting the best possible choices with the specification
    of the least information.

    If Z0 is not specified, the default 50 ohms is selected.
    The scaling factor is calculated as sqrt(|Re(Z0)|).
    These are provided in matrix form when needed and complex when needed

    both Z0 and K may be specified as lists, in which case they represent
    port reference impedance and scaling factors
