def CZT(x,Fs,fs,fe,M,highSpeed=True):
    """Provides M+1 points from fs to fe of the chirp z transform of the vector x
    @param x an input vector (list) of real time-domain samples
    @param Fs the sample rate of the the data samples in x
    @param fs the start frequency for the result
    @param fe the end frequency for the result
    @param M the number of points in the result (-1)
    @param highSpeed (optional, defaults to True) whether to use the high-speed,
    but unreadable version.  The readable, low-speed version is the definition
    is used for testing.
    @remark
    Technically, the chirp-z transform can evaluate the z-transform at equi-angularly
    spaced points on a somewhat arbitrary arc, but here, we use it to compute equi-angularly
    spaced points on the rim of the unit circle, and as such, it is used simply to resample
    data.  Usually, we set fs=0 and the result is an M+1 point DFT of the waveform from 0 to
    fs, without the same limitations imposed as the standard DFT.  
    The equation for the czt is:  
    \f$m\in 0\ldots M\f$  
    \f$X\left[m\right]=\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}x\left[k\right]\cdot e^{-j\cdot2\pi\cdot\frac{k\cdot m}{M}\cdot F_{e}}\f$
