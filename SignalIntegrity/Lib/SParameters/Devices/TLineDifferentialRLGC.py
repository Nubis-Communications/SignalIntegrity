        ports are 1,2,3,4 is +1,-1, +2, -2

        @param f list of float frequencies
        @param Rp float DC resistance of positive leg (ohms)
        @param Rsep float skin-effect resistance of positive leg (ohms/sqrt(Hz))
        @param Lp float inductance of positive leg (H)
        @param Gp float DC conductance of positive leg to ground (S)
        @param Cp float capacitance of positive leg to ground (F)
        @param dfp float dissipation factor (loss-tangent) of capacitance of positive leg to ground
        @param Rn float DC resistance of negative leg (ohms)
        @param Rsen float skin-effect resistance of negative leg (ohms/sqrt(Hz))
        @param Ln float inductance of negative leg (H)

        @param dfm float dissipation factor (loss-tangent) of mutual capacitance (F)
        @param Gm float mutual conductance (S)
        @param Lm float mutual inductance (H)
        @param Z0 (optional) float reference impedance (defaults to 50 ohms)
        @param K (optional) integer number of sections (defaults to zero)
        @param scale (optional) float amount to scale the line by (assuming all other values are per unit)
        @note Regarding number of sections, an approximate solution will be computed
        as a distributed line with the number of sections specified using the class
        TLineDifferentialRLGCApproximate, unless the number provided is zero (the default).\n

        If zero is specified, then tests will be made
        for the appropriate analytic model to use according to the following table:

        | uncoupled | balanced |  Model                                             |
        |:--------: |:--------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
        |  True     | X        | TLineDifferentialRLGCUncoupled                     |
        |  False    | True     | TLineDifferentialRLGCBalanced                      |
        |  False    | False    | TLineDifferentialRLGCApproximate                   |

        If, because of imbalance and coupling, the approximate model must be used, the number of
        sections changed from K=0 specified to a value that will provided a very good numerical
        approximation.

        The calculation is such that round-trip propagation time (twice the electrical length)
        of any one small section is no more than one percent of the fastest possible risetime.
