        Special computation of \f$\mathbf{A}^\dagger\f$ where

        @param Left optional matrix that appears to the left of \f$\mathbf{A}^\dagger\f$
        @param Right optional matrix that appears to the right of \f$\mathbf{A}^\dagger\f$
        @param Mul (optional) whether to provide the result \f$\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{A}^\dagger\cdot\mathbf{R}\f$.
        Otherwise, by default, \$A^\dagger\f$ is returned.
        @return matrix \f$\mathbf{A}^\dagger\f$
        @throw LinAlgError if matrix cannot be inverted
        @remark All matrices supplied can be either list of list or numpy matrix, but
        the return type is always a numpy matrix
        @details if trySVD if False and alwaysUseSVD is False, then the Left and Right
        arguments are ignored and an attempt is made at calculating the Moore-Penrose
        pseudo-inverse of \f$\mathbf{A}\f$.  if the condition number of the resulting inverse is less
        than the conditionNumberLimit, then this method fails.\n
        If alwaysUseSVD is True or there is a failure and trySVD is True, then the svd
        is used.  The svd is not _better_ than the pseudo-inverse, per se, but it is able
        to make use of the left and right matrices.\n
        Many of the problems are of the form \f$\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{A}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{R}\f$.
        In many cases, the matrices \f$\mathbf{L}\f$
        and/or \f$\mathbf{R}\f$ are such that the all of the elements of the inverse of
        \f$\mathbf{A}\f$ are not used.
        Think of it as we only want to find certain elements of the inverse.  Situations like
        this arise, for example, when we have two wires in parallel connected to two circuit
        nodes.  We are not able to calculate the current through each of the wires, but we
        are able to calculate the current into and out of the parallel combination.  Another
        example is a circuit with no ground reference provided and we are calculating the
        differential voltage across an element in the circuit.  In cases like this, it is
        not possible to calculate the values of each circuit node, yet the answer exists and
        can be found.\n
        Using the svd, \f$\mathbf{A}\f$ is decomposed into \f$\mathbf{U}\cdot diag\left(\sigma\right)\cdot\mathbf{V}^H\f$
        where if \f$\mathbf{U}\f$ is \f$R\times C\f$, \f$diag\left(\sigma\right)\f$
        is \f$C\times C\f$ and \f$\mathbf{V}\f$ is \f$C\times C\f$.  The inverse of \f$\mathbf{A}\f$
        can be written as \f$\mathbf{V}\cdot diag\left(\sigma\right)^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{U}^H\f$.\n
        Here, we multiply the matrix \f$\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{V}\f$ and the matrix \f$\mathbf{U}^H\cdot\mathbf{R}\f$.
        Then, if a column \f$rc\f$ of \f$\mathbf{L}\cdot\mathbf{V}\f$ is
        all zeros or a row \f$rc\f$ of \f$\mathbf{U}^H\cdot\mathbf{R}\f$ is zero,
        we know that the singular value \f$\sigma\left[rc\right]\f$ is
        not used and is irrelevant - we set it to one so that it can't harm us and return
        the inverse.
