class CallBacker(object):
    """CallBacker  
    To use callbacks, a class is derived from CallBacker.  
    Either the constructor of the derived class or some other mechanism should
    provide means for supplying the callback function, which is installed in a
    call to __init__.  
    The derived class, during some long operation, then calls the callback function
    periodically.  The callback function then has the opportunity to report its
    progress.  Returning False in the callback function should cause the operation
    to abort.  
    Here's a mini example derived class using CallBacker:  
    \code{.py}
    class ProcessingClass(Callbacker):
        def __init__(self,callback=None):
            ...
            Callbacker.__init__(callback)
            ...
        def LongProcessingFunction(self):
            for m in range(100):
                ...
                do some calculating.
                ...
                if not self.CallBack(m):
                    process was aborted
                    return
     \endcode
