    @remark
    This is actually an oddball construction and should not be confused with a typical differential
    transmission line.\n
    The symbol looks like a two-port transmission line with it's outer conductor exposed as ports on each
    side.\n
    Port 1 is the left side and port 2 is the right side of the two-port transmission line.\n
    Port 3 is the left, exposed, outer conductor and port 4 is the right, exposed outer conductor.\n
    @note this device is functionally equivalent to the two-port ideal lossless transmission line TLineFourPort() when
    ports 3 and 4 are grounded.
