 is Python based tools for solving four basic signal integrity problems.
 (See the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Introduction"

\end_inset

 for what these problems are).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrity
\series default
\shape default
 library is a Python package that is essentially a library of functions
 that can be used to solve these problems through Python scripts that you
 create.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 is a Tkinter based Python GUI application that relies on the SignalIntegrity
 library which allows users to solve problems in a graphical environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This software is the culmination of several years of effort.
 While writing a book on signal integrity (to be released by Cambridge Universit
y Press in mid-2019), I recognized patterns in the mathematics behind s-paramete
rs and s-parameter based systems that allow the math to be tweaked slightly
 to perform simulation, virtual probing, s-parameter generation and de-embedding
, all from the same basic mathematical concepts.
 The purpose and underlying principal of the book and theory is that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Engineers rely too heavily on tools that they don't understand, and it is
 not only within their grasp to understand the theory, it is really imperative
 to understand the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once you understand the theory, you can do many things yourself and gain
 the benefit of releasing yourself from reliance on expensive, black-box
 tools that you don't understand and which the vendors don't always explain.
 And once you understand the theory (and can even look at the source code),
 you can rely on yourself to solve problems and examine and understand the
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While writing this book on theory, I realized that even with an understanding
 of the theory, many relatively simple problems are still very complicated
 calculations and some software should be created based on this theory.
 So the book teaches the theory, but then also teaches how to use the software
 tools that utilize the theory.
 Originally all of these software tools were in the form of the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrity
\series default
\shape default
 library and were utilized from Python scripts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And finally, again during the development of this book and tools, I realized
 that even the scripts get too complicated and it would be good to have
 a GUI based application - that is 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
.
 But the development of the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrity
\series default
\shape default
 library first provided huge advantages - it can be tested well and can
 be utilized very flexibly.
 Currently there are about 1000 tests that test for proper behavior of the
 underlying library.
 As for the GUI, these are very difficult to test in an automated manner
 and by definition, must be a bit less flexible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A high percentage of tasks required by signal integrity engineers that are
 usually performed using expensive, closed, black box systems can be performed
 using this free, open-source tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While software tools are powerful and really help the signal integrity engineer,
 there are certain common mistakes made due to both quality of data input
 to the tools, and lack of basic understanding of what the tool is doing.
 We address these two issues by supplying many capabilities for understanding
 the quality of your input data, usually in the form of s-parameter files,
 and providing complete explanation of what the tool is doing all the way
 from theory (in the book that accompanies this software) and in the form
 of the software itself which can be examined and even modified.

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Port"

\end_inset

 helps define the s-parameters of the final circuit.
 As you must be aware, s-parameters are a vector of matrix elements, where
 each matrix element is for a particular frequency (these frequencies are
 defined by the calculation properties defined in the next section: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Setting-Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

) and each matrix defines the complex port-port relationship at that frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for a set of two-port s-parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{21}$
\end_inset

 refers to the port-port relationship as the output (reflected) wave from
 port 2 due to an incident wave on port 1 over all the frequencies.
 These port numbers are defined by the port element added in the schematic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add ports to a schematic, see

The calculation properties determine how the s-parameters are calculated,
 specifically the frequency points that are calculated.
 The calculation properties are the same set for all of the

 applications.
 With regard to s-parameter calculation, the elements of particular interest
 are the end frequency, which is the last frequency in the s-parameter calculati
on, and the frequency points, which are the number of frequency points that
 will be present in the final s-parameters calculated.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating the schematic for s-parameter generation and setting the
 calculation properties, the s-parameters are calculated using either the
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-S-parameters"

\end_inset

 command or the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-Button"

\end_inset

 toolbar button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that calculation will not be possible at all (i.e.
 the menu elements are disabled) if the schematic does not meet the criteria
 for s-parameter calculation.
 This criteria for the schematic regarding elements are that the schematic
 must:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
have at least one 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Port"

\end_inset

 element (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

In calculating the s-parameters, the first step is to convert the schematic
 shown into a 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlist"

\end_inset

.
 This netlist puts the graphical schematic into a text based description.
 Note that this netlist can be created, examined and saved separately if
 you want.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Export-Netlist"

\end_inset

 on ways of viewing and exporting the net lists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net list is passed to a 
\series bold
SystemSParametersNumericParser
\series default
 class as described in software documentation after which the s-parameters
 are extracted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During parsing of the net list, all devices listed are instantiated with
 the end frequency and number of frequency points specified in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
 If a file device is encountered, the s-parameters read from the file are
 resampled onto the end frequency and number of frequency points specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, for each frequency point, the s-parameters are generated of the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, things go wrong and an error is generated.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Errors-and-Exceptions"

\end_inset

 for an explanation of any errors generated during calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If everything goes correctly, a dialog will open with the ability to view
 the s-parameters calculated and save them to a file in the

\begin_layout Standard
Here we see three devices and four ports.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To build this example, we first create a 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:New-Project"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We added the devices by executing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, opening the Files category, and selecting the Four Port 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, we select the file: Sparq_demo_16.s4p.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also selected the left-most checkbox on the file name property so that
 it displays in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK and clicking the mouse causes the part to appear in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, our schematic looks like this:

\begin_layout Standard
Notice the red x's showing where the part pins are unconnected.
 Also note that the part is blue and the status message says 
\emph on

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We then add the mixed-mode converter devices by again executing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Part"

\end_inset

, opening the Miscellaneous category, and selecting the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPickerPowerMixedModeConverter.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part has no properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK and clicking the mouse causes the part to appear in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, our schematic looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep2.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we are converting single-ended to mixed-mode s-parameters, we need
 to hook the positive and negative ports of the left and right sides of
 the four-port device to the mixed-mode converters.
 But we don't really know for sure where the positive and negative ports
 are on this device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find out, we select our four port device and invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Edit-Properties"

\end_inset

.
 This brings up the part properties dialog again for the file device:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleFileProperties.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next to the file name, we see the view button.
 Pressing this brings up the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Viewer"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The s-parameters to view are selected from the box of buttons in the lower
 left.
 Selecting s31, we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleS31.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and selecting s41 we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleS41.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
s31 is clearly the positive thru response for the single-ended ports 1 and
 3 and s41 is clearly the ac-coupled response of the other input port to
 output port 3.
 There is no indication necessarily of which ports are inputs our outputs
 (i.e.
 on the left or right of the device) and no indication which of the input
 or output ports should be designated plus or minus, but it is safe to choose
 ports 1 and 2 as the left plus and minus ports and ports 3 and 4 as the
 right plus and minus ports (note that we should look at s42 and s41 to
 confirm this).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will need two mixed-mode converters.
 We have one already, so we drag it over and connect the plus and minus
 ports to ports 3 and 4 of our four-port transmission line as shown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep3.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's easy to get another mixed-mode converter on the other side.
 Just invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Duplicate-Part"

\end_inset

 with the mixed-mode converter selected and when the cursor changes to a
 finger, just click on the left of the file device to place a copy of the
 part.
 Since it is the wrong orientation, invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Flip-Horizontally"

\end_inset

 to flip it around and drag it into position as shown:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep4.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Port"

\end_inset

 to add a 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Port"

\end_inset

 to the circuit.
 When we do this, we see the part properties dialog for the port:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertiesPort.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the port number 1 has already been filled in.
 Press OK and click and drag the port into place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleStep5.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is customary for mixed-mode s-parameters to have ports 1, 2, 3, and 4
 to be D1, D2, C1, C2 where the D and C refer to the differential- and common-mo
de and the 1 and 2 refer to the left and right side of the transmission
 line.
 So we invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Duplicate-Part"

\end_inset

 and click the mouse and drag the new port to the right side of the device.
 Use 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

When we looked at the s-parameters, we can see that the end frequency is

\begin_layout Standard
To set the calculation properties for simulation, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties determine how the transfer parameters are calculated.
 Transfer parameters are frequency responses that define transfer characteristic
s from an input waveform to an output waveform.
 Input waveforms come from sources and output waveforms are provided at
 output probe locations in the circuit.
 An output waveform is a linear combination of input waveforms applied to
 filters that are the time-domain equivalent of the frequency responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency responses are calculated to the end frequency withe the frequency
 spacing specified, and the filters are calculated by taking the inverse-FFT
 of these frequency responses.
 As such, they end up having a sample rate that is twice the end frequency
 and an impulse response length that is the inverse of the frequency resolution
 and a number of points that are twice the number of frequency points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base sample rate should be set to the sample rate that you want the
 simulation to run at, which is twice the end frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impulse responses generated for the filters are always centered on time
 zero, meaning half of the impulse response is before time zero and half
 is after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that all of the s-parameters have been sampled sufficiently, meaning
 to the right end frequency and most importantly, with the proper spacing
 to provide an impulse response that does not have time-aliasing effects,
 then it is possible to specify an appropriate impulse response length in
 the calculation properties.
 But with the tool in its current state, there is no way to guarantee this
 - you must set it to a value that makes sense.
 But the key is that it must be long enough.
 If it is too short, the simulator produces incorrect waveforms.
 If it is too long, it just needs to do extra work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advice here is to set the impulse response length to a number that is
 twice the length of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter in time as how
 long you think the impulse response of the longest filter should be.
 Then, after the simulation completes, you should

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, of course nonsense, so let's understand what happened here and
 how the simulator works.
 Understand this, we need on more set of information - the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

, where we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationPropertiesDefault.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simulator operates by generating transfer parameters that convert waveforms
 generated from sources, in this case the step generator, into the output
 waveforms.
 In this case, since we have only one source, these are essentially two
 filters that are applied to the source waveform, one filter converting
 the source to Vin, the other converting the source to Vout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These filters are specified with a frequency response of 400 points with
 50 MHz spacing out to 20 GHz.
 If s-parameter files had appeared in the schematic, all s-parameters would
 be resampled to this specification during calculation of the transfer parameter
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The net effect of the transfer parameters calculation is two finite-impulse
 response (FIR) filters whose impulse response length is 20 ns.
 In the accompanying book that describes the theory, we explain all about
 this, but suffice it to say that the filter impulse response is 20 ns long
 with time 0 appearing in the middle (i.e.
 has 10 ns of filter duration prior to time zero and 10 ns after time zero).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since FFT methods are utilized, and since the FFT assumes that the frequency
 response represents the 
\emph on
impulse train response
\emph default
 (as opposed to a single impulse response), we have an opportunity for time-alia
sing effects, which we've certainly created.
 To see this, invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:View-Transfer-Parameters"

\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

 and we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep19.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the trivial filter that converts the source waveform VG1 into Vin.
 this filter is, of course, a single impulse as these two are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selecting Vout due to VG1 shows something more interesting:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep20.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we see that the filter is highly resonant, which is not surprising.
 We see this in the magnitude response in the upper left, to some degree
 from the 180 degree phase transition in the phase response in the upper
 right, in the impulse response in the lower left which is clearly not settled
 at the end, and we see the problem the most clearly from the step response
 in the lower right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the FFT methods utilized, we see that the unsettled response
 to the right continues from the left (at negative time) and is clearly
 giving us the wrong answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, we might provide better or automated ways of dealing with
 this, but this is a common problem, especially when s-parameters are used,
 and is worth seeing and dealing with manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, 20 ns worth of impulse response is insufficient.
 Let's use something like 100 ns.
 So we edit the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

, change the impulse response length to 100 ns, close the dialog returning
 to the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

, and recalculate.
 After adjusting the zoom a bit, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep21.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is clearly a much better result.
 You can examine the transfer parameters to see that the 100 ns impulse
 response did the trick.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examining the calculation properties we see the implications of the 100
 ns impulse response:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SimulatorExampleStep22.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It means that two thousand frequency points were required at 10 MHz spacing.
 If this system were provided through s-parameter measurements, this would
 be the frequency resolution required to get a good time-domain simulation
 - regardless of what kind of simulator were employed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final note, note that in the original, incorrect simulation, the waveform
 result was almost 200 ns long (it was 180 ns to be precise) and that the
 final result is 100 ns long.
 This is because the impulse response length is removed half from the front
 and half from the back of the waveform.
 This is explained in the accompanying book.
 This means that the input waveform must be sized properly to give you the
 result you want.
 If in my simulation, my desire was to see the step response starting at
 -10 ns until 30 ns, and understanding that the filter takes 50 ns from
 the front and back, we'd want an input waveform that starts at -60 ns and
 ends at 80 ns, for a 140 ns duration.

For virtual probing to work correctly, all sources of stimuli (i.e.
 waves entering the system, or sources of voltage and/or current) must be
 identified.
 In virtual probing, you don't supply stimuli, only tell it how it enters
 the system.
 This identification of stimuli is achieved through the use of the

Stimuli in virtual probing is surely the most confusing aspect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual probing operates in theory by accounting for all of the 
\emph on
waves
\emph default
 flowing around a system using observations of 
\emph on
voltages
\emph default
 at the measurement probe points.
 Now, since voltages are proportional to the sum of the forward and backward
 going waves at a given node, so how can you tell which way they are going?
 Well, if you look long enough such that any waves entering prior to the
 time you started looking have either died down or are insignificant, then
 everything works out fine.
 But the application needs to know where they are and which device ports
 they 
\emph on
emanate
\emph default
 from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a properly constrained system, you should have as many measurement probes
 as stimuli.
 For example, barring other sorts of numerical problems, for a single-ended
 transmitter, one measurement probe and one stimulus is enough.
 If the system contains a differential transmitter, two stimulus are required.
 Two measurement probes are required, or some assumptions are needed to
 further constrain the stimuli is required.
 Constraining stimuli is performed using independent and dependent stimuli
 and specifying the constraints through interconnections and weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To place an independent stimulus, use 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Add-Stim"

, leave the weight as 1.0, and place the tip of the arrow directly on the
 port of a device as shown:

 specify a device port from which waves emanate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a situation where you have have more stimuli than measurements,
 you can make the stimuli connected directly to the device ports 
\emph on
dependent
\emph default
 on an independent stimulus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, suppose you have the following situation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename DifferentialStimArrangement.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This virtual probing schematic says that you have two independent, single-ended
 sources of stimuli at a transmitter and that you are measuring the differential
 voltage at the transmitter and desiring to see the differential waveform
 at a perfectly terminated receiver.
 Here we have two stims and only one measurement probe which makes the system
 unsolvable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can rectify the situation by adding an independent stim and making the
 two stims at the transmitter output dependent on it, like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename DifferentialStimArrangementBalanced.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the two stims at the transmitter only showed one connection point
 at the arrow tip, the back of the arrow can also be connected.
 When the back of a stim is connected through a wire to arrow tip of another
 stim, it becomes dependent on it by an amount defined by the weight of
 the dependent stim.
 We change the weight by invoking 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Edit-Properties"

\end_inset

 with the stim selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This arrangement says that the top stim is now the same as the independent
 stim and that the bottom stim is the negative of the independent stim.
 Since we now have only one independent stim, the system is solvable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this does not imply that the voltage waveform will be balanced
 at the transmitter (i.e.
 no common mode component), only that we have promised that the waves emanating
 from the transmitters are balanced.

\begin_layout Standard
To set the calculation properties for virtual probing, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties determine how the transfer parameters are calculated.
 Transfer parameters are frequency responses that define transfer characteristic
s from an input waveform to an output waveform.
 Input waveforms come from measurement probes and output waveforms are provided
 at output probe locations in the circuit.
 An output waveform is a linear combination of input waveforms applied to
 filters that are the time-domain equivalent of the frequency responses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The frequency responses are calculated to the end frequency withe the frequency
 spacing specified, and the filters are calculated by taking the inverse-FFT
 of these frequency responses.
 As such, they end up having a sample rate that is twice the end frequency
 and an impulse response length that is the inverse of the frequency resolution
 and a number of points that are twice the number of frequency points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base sample rate should be set to the sample rate that you want the
 virtual calculation to run at, which is twice the end frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These impulse responses generated for the filters are always centered on
 time zero, meaning half of the impulse response is before time zero and
 half is after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that all of the s-parameters have been sampled sufficiently, meaning
 to the right end frequency and most importantly, with the proper spacing
 to provide an impulse response that does not have time-aliasing effects,
 then it is possible to specify an appropriate impulse response length in
 the calculation properties.
 But with the tool in its current state, there is no way to guarantee this
 - you must set it to a value that makes sense.
 But the key is that it must be long enough.
 If it is too short, the simulator produces incorrect waveforms.
 If it is too long, it just needs to do extra work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advice here is to set the impulse response length to a number that is
 twice the length of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter in time as how
 long you think the impulse response of the longest filter should be.
 Then, after the simulation completes, you should 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 from the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To try to get some feeling on how the properties should be set, we can invoke
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to see what the impulse responses look like resampled onto the desired
 calculation properties.
 But remember that your system contains many sets of such files that may
 cause the impulse response lengths needed for the transfer parameters to
 be different than what any individual s-parameter file shows.

 devices (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Output-Probes-for-Virtual-Probing"

 I will talk about these in a bit, but for now notice one interesting thing
 about the output probes named Voutloaded and Vout.
 These are in between two back-to-back 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Voltage-Mixed-Mode-Converter"

\end_inset

 devices.
 These devices placed back-to-pack expose the plus and minus terminals of
 a single-ended line on each side and the differential- and common-mode
 lines in the middle.
 These devices connected in this arrangement have no effect on the circuit
 (the two plus pins or the two minus pins could even be shorted together
 if you wanted).
 Thus, these output probes are probing the differential output at the output
 termination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these output probes have keyword/values of td -1.43ns and gain
 0.5.
 The gain is the gain applied to the output waveform.
 Since the input waveform is a single-ended measurement it is half the size
 of the differential waveform.
 We want to see relative changes is size, so we put the differential waveforms
 on the same relative scale as the single-ended waveforms.
 The time delay of -1.43 ns is to account for the delay through the channel.
 This was estimated by examining the s-parameters of the file Sparq_demo_16.s4p.
 You can do that by selecting the four-port file

\begin_layout Standard
Since there are multiple spikes in the impulse response, the differential
 time delay through the channels is roughly the time of the positive going

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The dependent stimuli are connected to the pin of each

 device representing the transmitters (remember, a voltage source looks
 like a short with waves emanating from it).
 These grounds are connected through a small piece of wire to the pins of
 50

Ω resistors.
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 for why this small piece of wire is necessary).
 A 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is connected with the arrow touching each pin of the grounds, meaning the
 stimulus emanates from the grounds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An independent stimulus is all the way to the left with wires connecting
 the arrow tip of the independent stimulus to the back of each of the stims.
 This means that the other stimuli depend on this stimulus.
 Note that in each of the circuit sections, the weights of the two bottom
 stims are -1.0 (the others are 1.0 and not shown).
 This means that the top stim in each circuit is the same as the independent
 stimulus and the bottom stim in each circuit is the negative of the independent
 stimulus.
 What we are saying here is that the waves emanating from the differential
 transmitters are balanced.
 See

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are providing a measured waveform Vprobe, and have output probes called:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vmeas - the measured input waveform at the transmitter.
 This waveform can be considered as the input waveform to the backplane
 with the probe loading the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Voutloaded - the waveform at the receiver to be produced by Virtual Probing.
 This waveform is the output waveform with the probe loading the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vin - the waveform at the transmitter in the bottom circuit to be produced
 by Virtual Probing.
 This waveform is the input waveform to the circuit if the probe were not
 loading the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vout - the waveform at the receiver to be produced by Virtual Probing.
 This waveform is the output waveform without the probe loading the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Virtual Probe is being asked to provide these waveforms given a single,
 single-ended measurement at the transmitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the problem being solved is three-fold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Voutloaded provides for a measurement in a different circuit location (the
 receiver) given a measurement taken at the transmitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vin provides for a measurement in the same system with the probe loading
 effects removed.
 In other words, it provides what the measurement would be were the probe
 perfect.
 In a sense, it is a deembedding of the loading effects of the probe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vout provides for a measurement of the output waveform from a system, without
 the probe loading the system.
 This measurement is usually the actual goal.
 Note that this could be used for compliance testing of systems without
 having the actual backplane - and in fact could be used for monte-carlo
 testing of compliance if run with many different backplanes whose existance
 is virtual - in the form of s-parameter files.
 (These backplanes might not even exist and might be the product of other
 signal integrity analysis tools).
 All we would need to get right for this compliance testing would be a model
 of the probe and probing structure connected to the transmitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first measurement we will take will be to see the effect of the probe
 loading in the measurement of the input waveform.
 So, select the two output probes at the output and move them off their
 connection points as shown.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before creating the output waveforms, you need to check that the calculation
 properties are appropriate.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Setting-Calculation-Properties-for-Virtual-Probing"

\end_inset

 for more information.
 Here we use the following settings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename CalculationPropertiesDefault.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoke  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculate-Button"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Virtual-Probe"

\end_inset

 to create the output waveforms in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbeProbeLoadingWaveforms.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amazingly, the new input waveform without the probe loading effects looks
 much better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's always a good idea to invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:View-Transfer-Parameters"

\end_inset

 to view the transfer parameters in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Viewer"

\end_inset

.
 Selecting Vin due to Vprobe, we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbeProbeLoadingTransferParameters.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the filter that was created to convert the probed waveform to the
 waveform that would be present without the probe loading effects.
 Here we see a resonance at around 1 GHz accounting for a resonant cavity
 in the probes response (this would not be a great probe in real life).
 We see this resonance in the impulse and step response and fortunately
 it dies down before 10 ns, so the calculation settings are okay for this
 situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's go back to the schematic and view the output waveform.
 Disconnect the Vin output probe and connect the Voutloaded output probe
 like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbingExampleProbingAtDifferentPoint.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoke  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to create the output waveforms in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbingExampleProbingAtDifferentPointWaveforms.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that because we applied the -1.43 ns delay and the half gain, they resemble
 each other.
 This is an example of using virtual probing to simply probe at a different
 location in the circuit than is actually being probed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This portion of the example does not give us what we really want.
 We want to see what the output waveform would be were the probe not loading
 the system.
 For this, we go back to the schematic, and disconnect the two output probes
 at the input and connect the output probes at the output, like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbeOutputsOnly.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoke  
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Control-Help:Virtual-Probe"

\end_inset

 to create the output waveforms in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulator-Dialog"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbeOutputsOnlyWaveforms.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we see a not so negligible difference between the output waveforms
 with and without the probe loading accounted for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we were able to probe at the input and produce an output waveform
 at the receiver that is independent of the probe effects.
 In fact, if we simply probe the transmitter driving a known termination
 with known probe effects, we could have gotten this same result.
 Furthermore, we'd be able to replace the four-port backplane with varieties
 of corner cases to test compliance, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoke 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to view the transfer parameters in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Selecting Vout due to Vprobe, we see:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VirtualProbeOutputsOnlyTransferParameters.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end, you can connect all of the output probes and run the calculation
 and save all of the waveforms by invoking 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 from the

 command at any time to view any file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the s-parameter viewer dialog is invoked from the menu, the user is
 asked to select a file for viewing.
 This file must have the extension .s[x]p where x is the number of ports.
 It must also be a valid touchstone file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dialog is broken into four panes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upper Left - Magnitude Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upper Right - Phase Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower Left - Impulse Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower Right - Step Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When s-parameters are read from a file, they are plotted exactly as read
 at the exact frequency points present in the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When s-parameters have been calculated, they are calculated according to
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

 as specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculation properties that you are allowed to specify force the result
 to be evenly spaced points from zero frequency to the end frequency specified.
 But for files read from the disk and produced outside these tools, the
 frequencies are often at odd locations and frequently don't include the
 zero frequency points.
 In these cases, the impulse response and step response cannot be shown
 and the panes are blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the dialog panes have their own, independent control of panning
 and zooming.
 These controls come standard with MatPlotLib (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://matplotlib.org"

\end_inset

), the standard Python way of plotting things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below the panes are an array of buttons determining the s-parameters being
 shown.
 If transfer parameters are being shown, the buttons are named not by port
 numbers but rather as relationships between, in the case of simulation,
 output probe voltages and source voltages or, in the case of virtual probing,
 output probe voltages and measurement probe voltages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory behind the s-parameter viewer dialog is that examination of s-paramet
ers, particularly for signal integrity, must include the time-domain, as
 the time-domain tells you how the s-parameters will perform in time-domain
 simulations.
 Speaking simply, the impulse response of the s-parameter shown is equivalent
 to a time-domain filter that filters waveforms.
 When viewing the impulse response, you should be looking for causality
 and settling issues caused mostly by insufficient frequency resolution.
 If there are bumps in the impulse response prior to time zero or prior
 to the electrical length of the device (that are not insignificant), then
 you have causality violations.
 If the impulse occurs near the end of the impulse response and you see
 remnants that wrap to the beginning of the response, you have insufficient
 frequency resolution.
 The step response highlights these type of problems and additionally show
 problems when impulse responses settle to non-zero values at the beginning
 and end of the response.
 If you have these response problems from s-parameters read from a file,
 then there is really nothing you can do with them.
 If you have these issues as a result of a calculation, then sometimes these
 problems can be repaired by changing the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the s-parameter file being viewed is an input file to any of the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 applications, then the file will end up getting resampled according to
 the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

 and the viewer is a good way to see the effects of this resampling, most
 importantly in the time-domain.
 As mentioned, if the s-parameter viewer dialog is invoked on a file, then
 the file is shown as read.
 Selecting resample from either the Calculate menu or the resample button
 shows what the s-parameters will look like when resampled by the application.
 If the time-domain results look poor after resampling, then you have a
 problem.
 Currently, in this version of 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
, the resampling algorithms are geared towards strictly proper resampling
 of files with equally spaced points and the application does a poor job
 of extrapolation.
 Part of this is on purpose, because you really should make sure that your
 measurement instruments or other simulation tools provide the proper s-paramete
r files, but in the future, the intent is to add many more tools and algorithms
 for properly dealing with these situations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in the s-parameter viewer dialog, you have the ability to read
 another file, or write the file to the disk using the file menu commands
 or toolbar buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also view the magnitude response and phase response with a 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Variable-Line-Width"

\end_inset

 which helps especially in viewing the phase response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the phase response there is the ability to unwrap the phase.
 Pressing this button does not strictly unwrap the phase, but calculates
 the principle delay in the impulse response (if the impulse response can
 be calculated) and removes this delay from the phase response shown.
 In the future, the intent is to probably entirely unwrap the phase, and
 to show the phase only when the magnitude response is not unreasonably
 small.
\end_layout

The top third contains all of the things that end up affecting the end frequency

 application, they are sampled with the

\end_inset

 set at the time of the calculation.
 If they are changed after the calculation, the results can be resampled
 by editing the values in this dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, oftentimes s-parameters are being viewed from files and are therefore
 sampled however they are on the disk.
 Resampling them allows the user to see ahead of time how they will be resampled
 during calculation to look for bad behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference impedance of the s-parameters can be changed from the default,
 which is the reference impedance of the s-parameters calculated or read
 in from a file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The negative and positive time limit contains the time limits for the impulse
 responses that have non-zero data.
 lower the magnitude of these limits causes the s-parameters to be limited
 in non-zero response to these limits.
 This is helpful to smooth out s-parameter data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, the best effects for limiting negative time, as for enforcing causality,
 is by setting the negative time limit the negative of the base sample period.

\begin_layout Standard
Allows viewing magnitude and phase response with a variable line width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is helpful in viewing the s-parameter with an intensity that depends
 on whether the value actually matters.
 This is especially helpful when looking at the phase response, which tends
 to vary wildly when the magnitude response is small.
 When the magnitude response is small, the phase response doesn't matter
 anyway, and this setting helps the user ignore these frequency locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The line width of the magnitude response and phase response vary depending
 on the magnitude response of the s-parameter.
 If the magnitude is large, a large line width is used and if the magnitude
 is small, a small line width is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, variable line width cannot operate properly along with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $k\in0\ldots K-1$

\begin_inset Formula $s\left[k\right]$
\end_inset

 represents a value of the step response at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t\left[k\right]$

\begin_inset Formula $t\left[k\right]$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\left[k\right]\approx Z0\cdot\frac{1+s\left[k\right]}{1-s\left[k\right]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 on the time is because the reflection must go into and out of the system
 (i.e.
 go twice the time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, this is called the impedance profile.
 It is not really appropriate for lumped element systems and is really only
 appropriate for transmission lines and cables, etc.
 That being said, sometimes the launches into these systems have impedance
 discontinuities that look like lumped excess inductance (high impedance)
 or lumped excess capacitance (low impedance).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calculation is an approximation because in systems with lots of or
 large reflections, the approximation of the impedance gets worse the further
 into the line you go.
 Here's an example of a open transmission line:
\end_layout


\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename OpenStub.png
	lyxscale 25
	scale 25

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is the step response:
\end_layout


\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename OpenStubStepResponse.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And here is the impedance profile calculated from the step response:
\end_layout


\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename OpenStubImpedance.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that something unnatural had to be done about the step response going
 above unity, which was to clip it at 3000 ohms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a zoom of the impedance profile:
\end_layout


\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename OpenStubImpedanceZoomed.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we see that the early part of the impedance profile shows a jump to
 100 ohms for 100 ps as expected, and then a large impedance jump (the open).
 What goes on beyond this zoomed portion is a result of the multiple reflections
 and is not correct.
\end_layout

There are more accurate methods possible (called peeling), but these are
 not implemented at this time.

Control help allows you to get help on any command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in control help, all of the commands are activated.
 This includes key bindings, toolbar buttons, and menu elements.
 However, issuing any of the possible commands takes you to a location in
 the help system corresponding to the desired control instead of actually
 issuing the command.
\end_layout

 These controls come standard with MatPlotLib, the standard Python way of
 plotting things.
 The plots have a legend in the upper right containing the name of the waveform
 plot being displayed and indication of its color in the plot.
 The axis for the plots are amplitude in Volts on the y axis, time in ns
 on the x axis.
 The waveform(s) are scaled and aligned as appropropriate originally.

\begin_layout Standard
During all of the calculations, a text-based net list is created that is
 passed to the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrity
\series default
\shape default
 toolbox software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The format of this net list is described in the accompanying book but somewhat
 under 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlist"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, you don't need to look at or save this net list, but examining
 it is helpful sometimes for debugging problems and saving it allows the
 schematic to be be utilized within customized Python based user applications
 that rely on the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrity
\series default
\shape default
 toolbox, but do not rely on the 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invoking this command causes the netlist to be generated that would be the
 same for any calculation and shown.
 For example, for this type of schematic:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExample.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would have a net list that looked like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename SParameterGenerationExampleNetListDialog.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pressing OK prompts you for a text file to save it to.
 Pressing Cancel or escape leaves without saving the file.

\begin_layout Standard
This causes the current schematic to be output in a graphical file format
 called 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TikZ"
target "https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en"

\end_inset

 which is interpreted in TeX and LaTeX based documents (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TeX Users Group (TUG)"
target "https://tug.org/"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the TikZ file is directly importable into a LaTeX based document, it is
 difficult to edit.
 Fortunately a (old) free tool exists called 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TpX"
target "http://tpx.sourceforge.net/"

\end_inset

 for creating graphics.
 The file format of a TpX file is actual TikZ code for the drawing with
 the TpX drawing information 
\emph on
commented out
\emph default
.
 Thus, a TpX file is directly importable into a LaTeX based document and only
 the TikZ code is interpreted.
 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 outputs the schematic this way, in TpX format so you can either directly
 import the schematic into a LaTeX based document, or if you install TpX, you
 can actually edit the schematic and save it as TikZ again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of differences between graphics drawing commands, the TpX and TikZ
 will vary slightly from the actual schematic shown in 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the future, a .png or some other rasterized graphics version should be
 created, but believe it or not, this is more difficult.
 For now, you're left with the screen capture methods built into the operating
 system to get this.

\begin_layout Standard
The Edit tasks are a category in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Main-Schematic-Dialog"

\end_inset

 and are broken into two sections, one involving undo and redo of schematic
 edits and the other dealing with multiple selections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Cut-Selected"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The undo and redo tasks depend on the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:History-Buffer"

\end_inset

 which records the state of the schematic at various events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
History Buffer
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 maintains a buffer containing the history of changes made to the project
 since the application started.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently it records the last 100 changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each change is labelled, so as a change is undid and redid, the name of
 the event that is undid is displayed in the status message area.

\begin_layout Standard
This adds one of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Built-in-Devices"

\end_inset

 to the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most useful and generic type of part for s-parameter files is the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:File"

\end_inset

 part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you add a part, you first see the part picker, which lists all of the
 part categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPicker.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By selecting a part category, you find the parts listed in that category:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPickerCategory.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You select a part and press OK to bring up the part properties dialog:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifier.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, you see the part properties at the top, followed
 by the part orientation settings, followed by a picture of the part as
 it will be shown in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the value.
 When first opened for a part, the default values are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the property is to be shown in the
 schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox determines whether the keyword for the property is displayed
 (unchecking this box just shows the value).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).
 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 100 Mohm can be entered as 100 Mohm, 100 M, 100M, 100e6, or
 10e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference designator is entered by 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 and is always unique at the time of entry.
 In that sense, it does not need to be modified or viewed in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientation of a part can be altered through rotation and mirroring.
 The rotation shown is always for a rotation in the counter-clockwise direction,
 but usually one just presses the toggle button until it looks right.
 Mirroring vertically or horizontally is accomplished by checking the boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have no control over the exact placement of the text displayed with
 each part.
 It is placed justified properly depending on the orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many parts, there are alternate part pictures available.
 These are chosen by simply clicking inside the the part picture area of
 the dialog.
 For example, for the voltage amplifier shown, there is an alternate picture
 that has the voltage reference reversed at the input.
 Clicking in the part picture changes the picture to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifierAlt.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you are satisfied with all of the part property settings and the orientati
on, press okay.
 The part properties dialog disappears and, when hovered over the canvas,
 you will see that your mouse cursor has now changed to a finger to indicate
 that the part can now be placed.
 left-clicking now has the part shown and selected:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename VoltageAmplifierAltSelected.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Keeping the button pressed, the part remains selected and can be precisely
 placed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that until a part is connected, you will see red x's wherever the unconnect
ed pins are on the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the part properties after the part has been placed, simply double-clic
k on the part to bring up the part properties, or select the device and
 use the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "Control-Help:Edit-Properties"

\end_inset

 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any time in the process of adding a part, you press the Cancel button
 (or <escape>), the part addition is aborted and you return to the schematic
 with no new part added.

 and selecting Port from the Special parts category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On this dialog, you see the only property, the port number, the orientation
 settings for the port, and a picture of the port element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The port part property are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the port number.
 The port number is filled in by default as the lowest port number not already
 in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the port number should be shown in
 the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox is superfluous for ports.
 For part properties it determines whether the keyword for the property
 should be shown, but a port number does not have a keyword, just the number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The port number is modified by clicking inside the white area where the
 port number value is shown.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the port number that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new port number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
keep in mind that when you have completed drawing your schematic, the port
 number values must be numbered from 1 to however many ports are present
 with no gaps in the numbers.
 Otherwise you will get an error when you go to calculate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are satisfied with the port number and orientation, press OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties dialog disappears and, when hovered over the canvas,
 you will see that your mouse cursor has now changed to a finger to indicate
 that the port can now be placed.
 left-clicking now has the port shown and selected:

Note that until a port is connected, you will see a red x at the port connection
 point.
\end_layout

To change the port number after the port has been placed, simply double-click
 on the part to bring up the part properties, or select the port and use

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selected part is indicated by a blue color in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a part is selected it shows this in the status message area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also available through the context sensitive menu (right-click when
 part selected).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a part is selected, editing the part properties brings up the part
 properties dialog:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifier.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the part properties dialog, you see the part properties at the top, followed
 by the part orientation settings, followed by a picture of the part as
 it will be shown in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The part properties are shown with two checkboxes, followed by a label,
 followed by the value.
 When first opened for a part, the default values are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first checkbox determines whether the property is to be shown in the
 schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second checkbox determines whether the keyword for the property is displayed
 (unchecking this box just shows the value).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).
 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 100 Mohm can be entered as 100 Mohm, 100 M, 100M, 100e6, or
 10e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reference designator is entered by 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default
\shape default
 and is always unique at the time of entry.
 In that sense, it does not need to be modified or viewed in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientation of a part can be altered through rotation and mirroring.
 The rotation shown is always for a rotation in the counter-clockwise direction,
 but usually one just presses the toggle button until it looks right.
 Mirroring vertically or horizontally is accomplished by checking the boxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have no control over the exact placement of the text displayed with
 each part.
 It is placed justified properly depending on the orientation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For many parts, there are alternate part pictures available.
 These are chosen by simply clicking inside the the part picture area of
 the dialog.
 For example, for the voltage amplifier shown, there is an alternate picture
 that has the voltage reference reversed at the input.
 Clicking in the part picture changes the picture to the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename PartPropertyVoltageAmplifierAlt.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you are satisfied with all of the part property settings and the orientati
on, press OK.
 The part is now edited in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any time you press Cancel, the properties of the part are left unchanged
 in the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some devices have file properties.
 For example, the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:File"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 devices have s-parameter files and the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Wires are simply collections of vertices with implied lines between each
 adjacent vertex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although wires might look continuous in the schematic, a wire only every
 actually joins two nodes with a node being either a device port or a dot
 in the schematic where two or more wires or device ports connect.
 A wire joining two nodes may still contain several vertices as it snakes
 around the schematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wires are consolidated continuously as the schematic is drawn so a wire
 might be split or combined as things are connected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wires can be selected by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a vertex - in which case just the vertex can be deleted or moved or the
 entire wire containing the vertex can be deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a segment (a line between two vertices), which is really just multiple selection
s of two vertices - in which case the two vertices can be moved or deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
multiple vertices.

\begin_layout Standard
The Add Wire command puts the schematic state-machine in the drawing wires
 state.
 When in this state, the cursor turns into a pencil and a wire is begun.
 A wire is defined by a sequence of vertices.
 clicking the left mouse button drops another vertex onto the schematic.
 If at least one vertex has been placed for a wire, a rubber band line extends
 from the last vertex placed to the grid coordinate closest to the cursor
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wires can only be placed on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you right click, that ends the current wire.
 If a vertex has been placed for the current wire (and a rubber band line
 is extending to the cursor), the rubber band line disappears, the vertices
 place define the wire drawn in the schematic and a new wire starts.
 The next left click places a vertex for that wire and the process continues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wire drawing ends when you right click twice.
 In other words, it ends when you right click in the middle of drawing a
 wire and no vertices for that wire have been placed.
 Pressing escape will also end wire drawing.

Panning allows you to change the offset of the grid in the drawing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's kind of like selecting everything and moving it, but instead of moving
 the elements in the drawing, the coordinates of the origin are modified
 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you invoke panning, the panning toolbar button stays down and the status
 message area shows Panning.
 The cursor changes to a panning symbol.
 You then pan by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the drawing
 origin relative to where the mouse button was pressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Releasing the mouse button or right clicking or pressing escape turns off
 panning.

\begin_layout Standard
The value is modified by clicking inside the white area where the property
 value is shown.
 Note that all property values that are numbers are shown in engineering
 notation (i.e.
 a number with a suffix indicating the exponent).

 never uses scientific notation or anything like that.
 Also, if the number has units, the units are shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the value, you can either click once or double-click inside the
 value entry box.
 When you click once, the cursor is placed at the location clicked and you
 can edit the value that is already there.
 If you double-click, the entry is cleared and you can enter an entirely
 new value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The units never need to be entered (but can be).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be entered with exponents or with the engineering notation suffix.
 For example, 20 GHz can be entered as 20 GHz, 20 G, 20G, 20e6, or 2e7.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever either the end frequency or the impulse response length are modified,
 all of the other properties are calculated as in the equations above.
 If any of the properties are modified that directly affect one of these
 base properties, then the affected base property is modified and all of
 the other properties are recalculated as stated.
 These properties include the frequency resolution, which is simply another
 expression of the impulse response length, and the base sample rate, which
 is simply another expression of the end frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, if either the frequency points or the time points are modified,
 which are functions of both of the base properties, then the end frequency
 is held constant and the impulse response length is modified to accommodate
 the new property value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize, all of the properties can be modified.
 Any modification first tries to hold the end frequency (and base sample
 rate) constant first and the impulse response length second.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting thing to note is that the frequency points are actually
 the number of frequencies minus one.
 Said differently, the number of actual frequencies calculated is always
 the number shown plus one.
 In other words, for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 frequency points and an end frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $Fe$
\end_inset

, the actual frequency points are, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in0\ldots N$

Control help allows you to get help on any command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in control help, all of the commands are activated.
 This includes key bindings, toolbar buttons, and menu elements.
 However, issuing any of the possible commands takes you to a location in
 the help system corresponding to the desired control instead of actually
 issuing the command.
\end_layout

Control help stays active until you either press the escape key, or touch
 somewhere in the canvas.

File Devices are the most generic.
 They take an s-parameter file name in the file name property.
 The in the Part Properties Dialog, you can browse to the file and view
 the file in the

File names can be projects.
 When browsing for file names, the default files type shown will be s-parameter
 files, but you can click on the files type and the choice of project files
 is shown.
 Then other projects can be selected as the source of the s-parameters.
 This allows nesting of projects.
 When you do this, you must ensure that the project you select for the s-paramet
er file is a project that produces s-parameters (i.e.
 a de-embedding or s-parameter generation project) and that the number of
 ports in the s-parameters produced matches the number of ports in your
 file type.

\begin_layout Standard
This is a four-port ideal transformer with a given turns ratio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary and secondary are labelled with P and S
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sense of the relationship between the primary and secondary is given
 by the dot locations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The turns ratio is secondary relative to primary, so a higher number indicates
 more secondary windings relative to the secondary.

Three and four port directional couplers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Directional couplers are ideal thru elements between the ports connected
 by a straight line.
 Waves going in the direction shown by the arrows are picked off in the
 direction shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A three port directional coupler picks off one wave, while a four port picks
 off both.
 In the end, the waves are voltage waves and when probed are the wave multiplied
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{Z0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these devices are not passive and are completely ideal.
 A real directional coupler could not pick a wave off entirely while simultaneou
sly passing waves between two ports.

A net name is shown with text and a single connection point.
 When the connection point is joined to a device pin or wire in the same
 manner any other device is joined, the net assumes that name.
 Thus multiple connections of net names with the same name essentially joins
 the nets.

Otherwise, if sections are large, then the model is created by cascading
 the sections with parameters that are divided by the number of sections.
 In other words, the parameters are for the total line, and each section
 has a value of the parameter divided by the number of sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is used to approximated distributed parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If zero sections are specified (the default), an analytic solution is provided
 based on complete distribution of the parameters specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To facilitate per-unit values, the model can be scaled by the amount specified.
 In this way, half-size models can be made (such as for 2x thru situations),
 or values can be considered as, for example, per meter, and the the scale
 can be considered as the number of meters.

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, if zero sections are specified and the lines are neither uncoupled
 nor balanced, the numerical approximation is used.
 In this case, the number of sections is calculated such that the round-trip
 time delay through any small section of the line is no longer than one
 percent of the fastest possible risetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To facilitate per-unit values, the model can be scaled by the amount specified.
 In this way, half-size models can be made (such as for 2x thru situations),
 or values can be considered as, for example, per meter, and the the scale
 can be considered as the number of meters.

\begin_layout Standard
This device is a two-port transmission line as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Telegrapher---Two-Port"

\end_inset

 where the constants for the transmission line are formed by fitting the
 s-parameters contained in the file specified to an RLGC transmission line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fit is performed by estimating the impedance and the delay through the
 line and using that to form a guess of the inductance and capacitance of
 the line.
 Initially no series resistance, skin-effect resistance, dissipation factor
 of conductance is in the guess.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fit proceeds until it converges and the fitted s-parameters are used
 as the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scale variable allows the fitted line to be scaled.
 This is particularly useful when model fitting to perform a 2x thru de-embeddin
g where a scale of 0.5 splits the model in half.

The waveform created has a sample rate as provided and extends in time from
 the horizontal offset, the time of the first point in the waveform, for
 the duration specified.

If zero risetime is specified, the waveform is 0 V until the start time,
 after which it jumps immediately to the amplitude specified for the remaining
 duration of the waveform.

\begin_layout Standard
The waveform created has a sample rate as provided and extends in time from
 the horizontal offset, the time of the first point in the waveform, for
 the duration specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If zero risetime is specified, the waveform is 0 V until the start time,
 after which it jumps immediately to the amplitude specified for the duration
 specified by the pulse width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a nonzero risetime is specified, the first edge crosses 50% at the start
 time and falls, crossing at 50% of the stop time (pulse width minus start
 time).
 In other words, the width of the pulse specified is the time between the
 starting and ending 50% points.

Ports can be optionally specified with a delay value.
 This is amount to peel from the port using impedance peeling techniques.
 Peeling is performed by de-embedding a portion of the line from the port,

 with the desired length, and characteristic impedance equal to the impedance
 profile calculated for the length specified (see

 pin but that are interrelated in some way with another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
defining stims - stims that define other stims.
 These are the stims that other dependent stims depend on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an independent or dependent stim is placed in a circuit, the arrow must
 connect directly to one and only one device port pin.
 It cannot be connected in the middle of a net and cannot be connected to
 two device pins directly connected together.
 This is because these stims define wave emanation from a device pin and
 if the arrow were connected to more than one device port, or in the middle
 of a wire, the device pin specified would be ambiguous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A defining stim must have it's arrow on a net containing only the tails
 of other dependent stims.
 This net can be formed by placing the arrow of a defining stim directly
 on the tails of other independent stims, or through wires connecting to
 the dependent stims, but again, the wire can only be connecting the arrow
 of a defining stim to the tails of one or more dependent stims with nothing
 else on the net.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a defining stim exists in the circuit, the netlist will contain a 
\emph on
stimdef
\emph default
 statement.
 The stimdef will define the relationship between the defining stims and
 the dependent stims determined by the weight property value for the stim.

At the time that this manual was written, the application software does
 not handle a rare special case properly - currently it requires that if
 there is at least one defining stim in the system, that all other stims
 beside the defining stims are dependent (i.e.
 there are no independent stims).
 To work around this (unlikely) situation (until the software is changed),
 if there is a defining stim in the system, and you have some stims that
 you want to be independent, then just place a new defining stim behind
 each independent stim (i.e.
 instantiate a new defining stim and place the arrow on the tail of the
 independent stim making it dependent).
 Then everything will work properly.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stims define sources of wave emanation, they 
\emph on
constrain
\emph default
 the solution to the system.
 In some sense, you can view the solution of determining the waves emanating
 from each stim with respect to each 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "device:Measure-Probe"

\end_inset

.
 Thus, for a properly constrained system, you should have a number of measure
 probes equal to the number of independent stims in the system (if there
 is no defining stim), or equal to the number of defining stims (see note
 above).
 You have an overconstrained system if you have more measurement probes
 and an underconstrained system if you have less.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is actually the purpose of the defining stim - to reduce the number
 of unknowns by enforcing a relationship between waves emanating from device
 ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the reference designator of the stim is not used for anything.

\begin_layout Standard
The operational amplifier is an amplifier that outputs a voltage proportional
 to the difference between the voltages at the input terminals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the default value of 1.0, the gain is usually set to a very large
 number.
 This input impedance is the impedance at each of the plus and minus input
 terminals to ground.
 The impedance between the inputs is infinite.

 Then other projects can be selected as the source of the s-parameters.
 This allows nesting of projects.
 When you do this, you must ensure that the project you select for the s-paramet

\end_layout

Unconnected Device Ports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One or more device ports in the schematic is not connected.
 With the exception of the system device used in deembedding applications,
 all device ports must be connected to one or more other device ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, by looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected
 device ports will have a red x on device pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the device port makes the
 red x disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and the
 wire itself might not be connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can troubleshoot connection problems exactly by looking at the netlist.
 The netlist will list each device with a name and number of ports and will
 list all connections between device ports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Duplicate Device Name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One or more devices in your schematic has the same device name.
 Usually, as you add devices to the schematic, you do not worry about the
 reference designations and the application adds unique reference designators
 as parts are added.
 These reference designators can be edited, however, by the user and the
 user can enter reference designations that are the same accidentally.
 To troubleshoot this problem, you can look both at the schematic, specifically
 the part properties for the devices, and at the netlist which will have
 device declarations with the same device name.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
No Device Named
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A connection or other type of declaration specifies a device name that is
 nonexistent.
 This type of error ought to be impossible to create from the application
 and is more typical of hand generated netlists.
 Nevertheless, this error message indicates that the netlist contains a
 reference to a device name (listed in the error) that is not specified
 elsewhere in the netlist.
 An error like this is really an internal error, but you can see the cause
 of an error like this by examining the netlist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Cannot Connect Device Ports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the same error as No Device Named, except that it was explicitly

 It also handles non-existent ports of the device if they cannot be found.

There are no output probes in the circuit.
 This type of error ought to be difficult to create from the application
 because the application checks for the existence of at least one output
 probe prior to enabling the simulation calculation, but it does not check
 whether the output probe is actually connected to anything.
 It is useful to leave some output probes unconnected and floating in the
 schematic to avoid calculation (for example, it might have been used for
 troubleshooting), but at least one of the output probes must be connected
 to the circuit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected output
 probes will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the output probe makes the
 red x disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and the
 wire itself might not be connected to anything.

 the output probe is actually connected to anything.
 If it is not connected, it ought to generate an Unconnected Device Ports
 error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can see this, because unconnected sources

 In the context of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By looking at your schematic, you can examine unconnected stims, because
 they will have a red x on their connection pins.
 That being said, simply connecting a wire to the pins of a stim makes the
 red x's disappear (because it is connected to the vertex of a wire) and
 the wire itself might not be connected to anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stims also require that the end of the arrow is connected directly to a
 device port.
 This is because unlike waves which are present along a wire, stims represent
 waves that emanate from a device port.
 Unfortunately, the schematic editor allows you to make this mistake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, stims must be connected to only one device port.
 While the schematic editor allows device ports to be connected directly
 together, when a stim is connected to a device port, the device port must
 be separated from others in the schematic by a small piece of wire.

Incorrect Matrix Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This cryptic error is an all encompassing error to indicate that something
 is wrong with the number of stims or measures in your system.
 In virtual probing, the number of independent stims (stims without the
 non-arrow side connected) must be less than or equal to the number of measure
 probes in the system.
 This error probably indicates that this is not the case (I say probably
 because there are other sources of this error especially when hand created
 netlists are entered into the system).

Understanding this error involves understanding the theory in the accompanying
 book.
 Suffice it to say that the problem is ill-determined in the sense that
 the system characteristics matrix is not invertible.
 This occurs under many pathological cases, some of which can be worked
 around and others cannot (i.e.
 there is simply no solution to the problem).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a pathological case that cannot be worked around are attempts
 to de-embed elements in systems where elements are present that do not
 pass anything (at a given frequency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Examples of pathological cases that can be worked around are circuit nodes
 whose absolute voltage or current cannot be determined due to the construction
 of the circuit.
 Sometimes, these can be worked around through the insertion of large resistors
 to ground or tiny series resistors.
 A detailed examination of the circuit would be necessary.

\begin_layout Standard
This error class is for errors parsing 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Mandatory Keywords Not Supplied
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This error message states that mandatory keywords and values were not supplied
 to the device parser for a particular 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:device"

\end_inset

 line in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlist"

\end_inset

, defining one of the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Built-in-Devices"

\end_inset

.
 This would be an internal error to the application because you cannot really
 control this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The keyword error looks like: ['keyword1','keyword2',\SpecialChar \ldots{}
] for 'deviceName'
 where 'keyword1' and 'keyword2' are representative of keywords that must
 be defined for the device and 'deviceName' is representative of the name
 of the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a keyword is '', then the device takes an argument without a keyword
 (the keyword is inherent - see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:device"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an error message that says that the keywords not supplied are:
 [''] for file, this means that the file name (which is not specified with
 a keyword) was not supplied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering netlists by hand, it is easy to forget a mandatory keyword,
 but in 
\series bold
\shape italic
SignalIntegrityApp
\series default

, this is difficult since the application creates the netlist entry from
 the instantiated part in the schematic.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Waveform consists of a sequence of points representing either voltage
 or current.
 It is defined by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
horizontal offset
\emph default
.
 The horizontal offset is simply the time of the first point in the waveform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The number of points in the waveform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The sample rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A sequence of points representing voltage or current.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for a horizontal offset 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, a number of points 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, and a sample rate 
\begin_inset Formula $Fs$
\end_inset

 and a sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 points, for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in0\ldots K-1$
\end_inset

, we have the voltage or current value specified as 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left[k\right]$
\end_inset

 and a time 
\begin_inset Formula $t\left[k\right]$
\end_inset

 where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t\left[k\right]=\frac{k}{K}\cdot\frac{1}{Fs}+h
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A waveform file is a text file where the first line contains the horizontal
 offset, in seconds, the second line contains the integer number of points
 in the waveform, the third line contains the sample rate in samples per
 second, and the remaining lines contain the waveform values.

By default, pin numbers are shown only for devices that require them, namely
 all devices that take in a file.
 In these cases, the pin numbering must match the port numbering of the
 file being read.
 Otherwise, internal devices known by the application have their pin numbers
 inherent in the symbol and therefore it is not really necessary to know
 how the pins are numbered.
 That being said, when viewing the s-parameters of the device, or when simply
 checking the symbol versus the s-parameters, it is sometimes useful to
 see this numbering.
 Setting this preference to True causes almost all devices to show pin numbers.
 Devices that will not show pin numbers ever are devices that are perfectly
 symmetric.

Sometimes, there are circuit configurations that have valid answers, but
 cannot be calculated in traditional ways.
 A good example of such a circuit is shown above where there is a zero-length
 transmission line in parallel with a wire between two ports.
 Without try SVD set, this s-parameter calculation fails because the 
\emph on
weights matrix
\emph default
 cannot be inverted.
 Essentially, what this means is that the value of each and every node in
 the system cannot be calculated.
 Here, however, we are concerned only with the port-port behavior.
 Although the wave propagation through every path cannot be computed in
 this circuit, it is known that this circuit is essentially a zero length
 wire and the s-parameters of such a circuit is well known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Try SVD allows the use of singular value decomposition in the inversion
 of the weights matrix.
 Singular value decomposition is a decomposition of the matrix into several
 others.
 While the decomposition itself does not enable inversion, the side matrices
 can be combined with any matrices that multiply on the sides, allowing
 portions of the matrix to be ignored.
 This is the same as saying that despite the fact that the inverse of the
 matrix does not exist, some of the elements of the matrix inverse can be
 calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the SVD is only necessary in somewhat odd situations, it does enable
 computation of the result.
 The reason why it's experimental is that in some cases it computes nonsense
 answers.

Here are some of the reasons to use it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
circuits containing parallel loops of wires causing indeterminate internal
 current flow.

\begin_layout Itemize
circuits where all nodes do not have a good ground reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulations involving current or differential voltage measurements where
 the circuit has no absolute ground reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some failures of this method are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulations determining the current in parallel loops of wire.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulations with voltage sources shorted to ground.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This preference determines whether results will be 
\emph on
cached
\emph default
 to speed up computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caching is performed on transfer matrix calculations performed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Virtual-Probing"

\end_inset

 and on s-parameter results in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Generation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Deembedding"

\end_inset

.
 No caching is performed on any waveform results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Caching is performed by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generating a hash corresponding to the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Netlist"

\end_inset

 and calculation properties (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Setting-Calculation-Properties"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Attempting to load a cache file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Comparing the hash to the hash stored in the cache file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Comparing the timestamp of the cache file to the timestamp of any of the
 files required in the calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If this preference is True, whenever a calculation result is computed by
 the application, a cached result is written with a filename prefixed by
 the project file name, and suffixed with a concatenation of the word '_cached'
 and either 'TransferMatrices.p' for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Virtual-Probing"

\end_inset

 or 'SParameters.p' for 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:S-parameter-Generation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Deembedding"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the simulation project file named 'RLCTest.xml' would produce
 cached transfer matrices named 'RLCTest_cachedTransferMatrices.p' and the
 s-parameter project file 'CascadedTwoPorts' would produce the cached s-paramete
rs named 'CascadedTwoPorts_cachedSParameters.p'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, when this preference is set to True, transfer matrices or s-parameters
 from a cached file would be utilized whenever 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Calculate"

\end_inset

 is initiated, the cached file is found, the hash matches the hash of the
 netlist and calculation properties, and the timestamp of the cached file
 is later than any files utilized in the calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since only transfer matrices are cached in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Simulation"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Virtual-Probing"

\end_inset

 applications, waveform processing always proceeds as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using caching greatly speeds up computation, but tends to litter the disk
 with these files, which can be quite large.
 It's useful to occasionally delete all of the files named '*_cached*.p'
 from the system.
 This must be performed manually.

This preference is created for the unlikely event that the online software
 help system has been moved.
 It's more likely that you would receive an updated software version from
 the new site and it would have the correct URL for the new help system
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the help system is located online at: 'http://teledynelecroy.github.io/
SignalIntegrity/SignalIntegrity/App'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That being said, in a complicated manner, the help system can be retrieved
 from a branch called 'gh-pages' from the git repository and placed on your
 local disk.
 This is especially useful for debugging as the help system is being modified.
 For example, if a git repository has been created in the directory 'SignalInteg
rityPages' and the gh-pages master branch pulled, the local help system
 can be accessed from 'file:///home/peterp/Work/SignalIntegrityPages/SignalInteg
rity/App'.
 Note that in this case the actual base of the help system will be at '/home/pet
erp/Work/SignalIntegrityPages/SignalIntegrity/App/Help/Help.html.LyX
